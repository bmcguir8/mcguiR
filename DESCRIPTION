Description: Generating plots to compare different aspects of logistic regression
    modeling is tough, so I wrote a bunch of functions that ease the burden a bit!  
    This package includes functions that calculate the accuracy of the model at
    different probability cutoffs (and plots it), calculates the TPR and FPR at 
    each different probability cuttoff for ROC plots and AUC calculuations, 
    as well as general useful modeling plots.
